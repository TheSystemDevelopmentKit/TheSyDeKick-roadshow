    \begin{itemize}
        \item TheSyDeKick is a framework to enable programmatic
            verification of complex mixed signal systems. Contributed by
            multiple designers.

        \item TheSyDeKick is a well structured container for: 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Python packages (Entities), that provide
                    \emph{formalism and methods to run simulations in
                    python, and with external simulators}
                \item Python packages (Entities), that provide
                    formalism to create and use \emph{IO compatible models}

            methods that help the designer to carry out the most common
            tasks encountered in microelectronics design. Most likely the
            \emph{simulation task you have in mind has some supporting

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Write and simulate modular, hierarchical, IO compatible
                hardware models with various levels of abstraction (python,
                spice/RTL or even EM field simulator)
            \item Control the abstraction level with one parameter on
                chosen level of hierarchy.
        \end{itemize}
        \item TheSyDeKick is \emph{nothing more}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item General (w.r.t to simulator), reusable simulation testbenches
            \item Centralized post processing based on open source tools and
                libraries.
        \end{itemize}
            \item Save time in re-writing testbenches for different simulations and centralize effort to all-in-one testbench
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Currently support for DC, AC, and Transient analysis. Easy to
            add other analysis types as IO formats are the same.
