        \item Ultimate goal of \textbf{spice}: support for most industry standard simulators
        \begin{itemize}
            \item General (w.r.t to simulator), reusable simulation testbenches
            \item Centralized post processing based on open source tools and
                libraries.
        \end{itemize}
            \item Save time in re-writing testbenches for different simulations and centralize effort to all-in-one testbench
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Currently support for DC, AC, and Transient analysis. Easy to
            add other analysis types as IO formats are the same.

                generated for both Verilog and VHDL design under tests.
            \item Automated file IO generation for strings (bit vectors), integers, and complex numbers.

                \item Specify run cases, e.g. transient analysis for 2 different netlists, etc.

            \item Once you have one testbench, reuse for similar applications makes things faster
            \item Results saved (if user chooses so), no need to repeat lengthy simulations to fix errors in post processing
